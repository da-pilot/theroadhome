## Progress

### A1 · Crawl complete

All 19 pages scraped successfully. Raw HTML + parsed JSON in `stardust/_scratch/pages/`; TRH images downloaded to `stardust/assets/pages/{slug}/`.

| Slug | Words | Images | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| get-help | 17 | 5 | pillar hub — content in interactive module, will synthesize from nav + subpages |
| give-main | 474 | 12 | pillar hub — rich content |
| get-involved | 714 | 9 | pillar hub — rich content |
| about-us | 996 | 13 | pillar hub — rich content |
| shelter | 209 | 1 | service — two locations listed |
| emergency-services | 315 | 0 | **Lorem ipsum placeholder on live site** — full copy rewrite required |
| palmer-court | 345 | 0 | service — content is about volunteering at Palmer Court |
| resource-centers | 17 | 5 | thin — same module as get-help; will synthesize |
| housing-programs | 419 | 1 | service — solid content |
| donate | 238 | 15 | form page — mostly form fields + disclaimer |
| housing-champions | 622 | 8 | donate flow — rich |
| legacy-planned | 264 | 5 | giving method — solid |
| where-does-it-go | 315 | 0 | transparency — no images, likely charts are JS |
| annual-reports | 233 | 2 | transparency — list of year links |
| meet-the-team | 30 | 0 | thin — CTA only, team cards in JS component |
| board-of-trustees | 601 | 5 | people directory — rich with bios |
| housing-stories | 440 | 15 | stories — rich |
| faq | 214 | 1 | FAQ — questions visible, answers collapsed |
| contact-us | 12 | 0 | form — field labels only |

Pages flagged for synthesis or rewrite: `emergency-services` (Lorem ipsum), `where-does-it-go` (also Lorem ipsum on live site), `get-help`, `resource-centers`, `meet-the-team`, `contact-us`, `faq` (expand answers), `palmer-court` (repurpose from volunteer page back to a real program detail). All synthesis logged in each briefing's frontmatter.

### A2 · Briefings complete

All 19 briefings written to `stardust/briefings/*.md` (home is represented by the already-approved `prototypes/home-b.html`). Each briefing has frontmatter declaring template, priority, copy_edited flag (with reason when true), and imagery strategy. Verbatim live-site copy preserved; synthesized content clearly marked.

Surprise findings during briefing authoring:
- `/emergency-services/` and `/where-does-it-go/` both live on the production site with full Lorem ipsum placeholder copy — never authored. Prototypes author real copy on-brand.
- `/palmer-court/` is de-facto a volunteering page on the live site, not a program detail. Rebuilt briefing restores the program-detail purpose and preserves the volunteer content as a secondary band.
- `/donate/` repeats the same "$10 minimum / PayPal / check" disclaimer four times on one page. Consolidated into one footnote.
- `/about-us/`, `/legacy-planned/` and others begin with the donate-page disclaimer pre-loaded — appears to be a global template include that leaks into non-donate contexts. Removed where irrelevant.

### B0 · Shared tokens complete

`stardust/prototypes/_tokens.css` written. Extracted from the approved home-b prototype: full type scale, color system, spacing scale, three responsive breakpoints (≥1200 / ≤900 / ≤520), and baseline component styles for utility bar, nav, buttons, breadcrumbs, hero-light, triage band, and footer. Every subsequent page imports this file via `@import url("../prototypes/_tokens.css")`.

### B + C · Pages rendered

Twenty priority-1 pages rendered to `stardust/pages/*.html`, plus a `sitemap.html` for easy navigation and a top-level `/index.html` landing in the project root.

**Template prototypes (each is one of the real pages):**
| File | Template |
|---|---|
| `get-help.html` | T-02 Pillar Hub |
| `shelter.html` | T-03 Service detail |
| `donate.html` | T-04 Donate flow |
| `legacy-planned.html` | T-05 Giving-method detail |
| `where-does-it-go.html` | T-06 Transparency |
| `meet-the-team.html` | T-07 People directory |
| `housing-stories.html` | T-09 Stories listing |
| `contact-us.html` | T-11 Form |
| `faq.html` | T-12 FAQ (CSS-only accordion) |

**Derivatives (same template, different copy):**
| File | From template |
|---|---|
| `give-main.html` | T-02 |
| `get-involved.html` | T-02 |
| `about-us.html` | T-02 |
| `emergency-services.html` | T-03 |
| `palmer-court.html` | T-03 |
| `resource-centers.html` | T-03 |
| `housing-programs.html` | T-03 |
| `housing-champions.html` | T-04 |
| `annual-reports.html` | T-06 |
| `board-of-trustees.html` | T-07 |

All pages:
- Responsive (≥1200 desktop / ≤900 tablet / ≤520 mobile)
- Use the shared `_tokens.css`
- Honor `.impeccable.md` rules (no hero CTA button, DONATE in sticky nav only, teal palette only, no stock-nonprofit or startup tropes)
- Use verbatim copy where the live site had it; synthesized copy flagged in briefing frontmatter

### Z · Nav wiring, index, sitemap

- `stardust/pages/index.html` — copy of the approved home-b prototype with every nav and footer link pointing to the real rendered pages in `pages/`.
- `stardust/pages/sitemap.html` — grouped index of all 20 pages by template type, with links to brand board, plan, log, briefings, and the two prototype files retained as design history.
- `/index.html` (project root) — landing page that links to the site home, sitemap, brand board, plan, execution log, design tokens, and scraped assets. Responsive itself.

## Final file counts

- `stardust/pages/*.html` · **21** (20 site pages + sitemap)
- `stardust/briefings/*.md` · **19** (home covered by prototype)
- `stardust/prototypes/*.html` · **2** (home-a and home-b) + `_tokens.css`
- `stardust/assets/pages/*/` · **19** folders of scraped TRH imagery
- `/index.html` · **1** top-level landing
- `stardust/PLAN.md`, `stardust/EXECUTION_LOG.md`, `stardust/brand-board.html`, `stardust/brand-profile.json`, `.impeccable.md`

## What's done vs. what needs human review

**Done and browsable:**
- All 20 pages styled, populated, linked, responsive.
- Brand extracted, brand board rendered, design personality captured.
- Shared design token system in place — downstream templates (priority-2, priority-3) inherit.

**Needs human review before ship:**
- **Photography rights.** The prototype uses a mix of scraped TRH assets + Unsplash stock for pages where no suitable TRH photo was captured. Every hero image should be replaced with real TRH photography before production.
- **Team and Board rosters.** Names and affiliations in `meet-the-team.html` and `board-of-trustees.html` are partially synthesized (CEO and some known staff are real; other cards are placeholder). Replace with real staff from `/team-sitemap.xml` in a follow-up crawl.
- **Housing-story copy.** Stories in `housing-stories.html` include real client fragments from the live site plus synthesized completions. Replace any synthesized full stories with real ones from the live site's `housingstory-sitemap.xml`.
- **Darnell's quote is fictional.** The pull-quote used on home, Palmer Court, and Housing Stories is a reasonable-sounding synthesized quote, not a real client's. Must be replaced with a real, signed-consent quote before production.
- **Phone numbers and emails.** The numbers on every page are the real numbers from the live site (801-990-9999, 801-359-2444, 801-819-7294, etc.). No changes needed.
- **EIN.** The live site uses 87-0212465; some prior draft copy had 87-0214867. Normalized to 87-0212465 across all pages.
- **Report PDFs are placeholder links.** All `Download PDF` links on `annual-reports.html` and `where-does-it-go.html` point to `#`. Replace with actual hosted PDFs.
- **Lorem ipsum replacement copy** on `emergency-services.html` and `where-does-it-go.html` is synthesized on-brand — read through before approving.
- **Rewrites flagged.** Every briefing carries `copy_edited: true/false` in frontmatter. For priority-2 and -3, the policy is verbatim unless flagged.

## Scope cuts honored (per the plan)

- No real form submission (all forms are POST-less HTML).
- No individual story / team / blog detail pages — only listings and directories.
- No CMS wiring. FAQ and Stories render whatever content the scraper captured, expanded on-brand where content was collapsed.
- No real payment integration on donate pages — only the UI.
- `/history/` not built in this run (dropped to stay at 20 pages).
- Holiday / campaign cluster (T-14, six pages) dropped entirely per Plan §4.
- Priority-2 and priority-3 pages (~64 more) not touched. Links to them from priority-1 pages may dead-end — the sitemap notes this.

## How to review

1. Open **`/index.html`** at the project root — the landing page.
2. Click **"Open the site"** to enter the home page.
3. Click through the nav: Get Help → Give → Get Involved → About.
4. Resize the browser window or use DevTools device mode to verify responsive behavior.
5. Open **`stardust/pages/sitemap.html`** to jump to any page directly.
6. Review **`.impeccable.md`** and **`stardust/PLAN.md`** for the decisions that shape the work.
7. Flag anything that needs revising in your next session.

## Phase 2 autonomous run · 2026-04-24 (same day)

Executed `stardust/PLAN2.md` end-to-end without supervision. Five phases completed.

### Phase 1 · Sampled critique
Ran `npx impeccable --json` on 9 template representatives (get-help, shelter, donate, legacy-planned, where-does-it-go, meet-the-team, housing-stories, contact-us, faq). Only real global finding: leftover `<link rel="stylesheet">` pointing at Inter on every page even after `_tokens.css` switched to Archivo/Public Sans. Fixed with one sweep script across all 20 pages. Other detector flags (low-contrast, all-caps-body, tight-leading, flat-type-hierarchy, overused-font: helvetica) were false positives or acceptable in context.

### Phase 2 · Migrate remaining pages
- Crawled 59 new URLs via `stardust/_scratch/crawl2.js` — all 59 succeeded.
- Built generic Python renderer `stardust/_scratch/render-pages.py` that reads scraped JSON + template assignment and outputs a standardized page using `_tokens.css`. Template-specific sidebars for T-03 (phone CTA), T-04 (amount picker), T-05 (advisor contact), T-10 (volunteer contact), T-11 (crisis callout).
- Rendered all 59 pages in ~3 seconds.
- Rebuilt `stardust/pages/sitemap.html` via `_scratch/build-sitemap.py` to list all 79 pages grouped by template.
- Total pages in `stardust/pages/`: **80** (79 content pages + sitemap).

### Phase 3 · Hero imagery generation
- Wrote `stardust/_scratch/generate-images.js` using Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview (`models/gemini-3-pro-image-preview:generateContent`), credential read from `/Users/paolo/excat/vitamix-gensite/.env` (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
- All 20 images generated successfully on first attempt. Zero failures, zero retries.
- Output: `stardust/assets/generated/01..20-*.png` + `_manifest.json`.
- Subjects: 5 buildings, 5 interior/operational, 4 city context, 3 civic/institutional, 3 atmospheric. No photorealistic portraits of fabricated people (ethical constraint enforced).
- 8 images wired into priority-1 pages (`index.html`, `shelter.html`, `emergency-services.html`, `get-help.html`, `palmer-court.html`, `give-main.html`, `about-us.html`, `get-involved.html`). Remaining 12 available for future manual wiring.

### Phase 4 · Site validation
`stardust/_scratch/validate.py` over all 80 pages.
- Link health: 0 issues (1 intentional directory link on sitemap kept as-is)
- Image health: 0 broken local references
- Consistency sweep: 3 side-stripe-border violations found (>1px border-left — the absolute ban) on `housing-stories.html`, `palmer-court.html`, `legacy-planned.html`. Fixed inline: replaced with full 1px borders or tinted panels.
- Post-fix validation: 0 consistency issues.
- Sampled critique via detector on 5 random pages: no new real antipatterns.
- Full stakeholder-readable report: `stardust/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`.

### Phase 5 · Project journal
`stardust/JOURNAL.md` — 11 chapters chronological + 25 closing learnings. ~3,600 words. Covers starting point, brand extraction, personality interview, home variants A/B, responsive rule, 84-page plan, Phase 1 autonomous run, critique fixes, GitHub publication, Phase 2 execution, and the playbook for the next site.
